# My first web game

As a beginner, this was my first hack at making an RPG web game. I had really wanted to make a web project for a while, and when HackClub's CodeQuest came, it finally pushed me over the edge, and I started developing this game!

This game was set up with vite, and I somewhat followed a tutorial for the beginning, but like hey it ended up being real cool!

## How to play

To play, use the arrows or WASD. Use the space bar to talk to the NPCs, and just follow their advice. This game is best played in full screen mode.
