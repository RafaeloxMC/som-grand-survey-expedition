                This tomb contains the heroic soldiers who bravly defended our

                these soldiers used heat to there advantage, but lots of them
                were wounded in battle, and they couldn't move, burning to death
                in the sun.

                formed after a fatal land slide, destroying villages, and
                collapsing caves. Now you can only get in through, by jumping in
                the deep underground lake.
