        "Did you know there are around 1137 different drawings of Orpheus? (Look at them all at: https://rawr.hackclub.com/)",
        "Hello, World!",
        "Idk what to write here",
        "Water is essential for life on Earth, and the human body consists of approximately 55-78% water, which is important for metabolism and concentration. So drink some water for your health :)",
        "The Great Wall of China is so long (over 21,000 km) that it crosses 15 regions of China, but it is not visible from space with the naked eye, contrary to popular belief.",
        "The catacombs of Paris extend over 300 km beneath the city, with only 1.5 km open to the public. They contain the remains of an estimated 6 to 7 million people who were brought here from overcrowded cemeteries at the end of the 18th century. The network originally consisted of limestone quarries, some of which date back to the 13th century.",
        "The Kola Superdeep Borehole in Russia reaches 12,262 metres (over 12 km) deep, making it the deepest man-made hole on Earth. Scientists expected to hit the Earth’s mantle, but found highly metamorphosed granite and microscopic fossils instead, showing life existed much deeper than thought. Temperatures reached 180 °C, hotter than predicted, forcing drilling to stop.",
        "Many ancient tombs, like those in Egypt, were aligned with the stars, often the constellation Orion, believed to guide the deceased to the afterlife.",
        "Please don't jump!",
        "Did you know that, in a perfectly empty room, your voice can sound completely different? With no objects to absorb sound, your words bounce off the walls, creating strong echoes. This is called reverberation. In some extreme cases, like in an anechoic chamber, you wouldn’t hear any echo at all — just your own heartbeat and breathing. So, standing in the middle of an empty room, you might say: “Hello?” …and get the creepiest reply ever: “Hello… hello… hello…”"

        "Once upon a time there was a young Orpheus. He always wanted to be a big explorer but feared what lay beyond the safety of his village. One day, he found an ancient map leading to a hidden tomb deep in the mountains. With courage in his heart, he followed the path, facing darkness and danger. Inside, he uncovered secrets lost to time and proved himself a true adventurer. And he lived happily ever after.",

        "Long ago, a forgotten king sought eternal life. He bound his soul through a dark ritual, sealing it within this tomb. The candles mark the circle of power where his spirit lingers, whispering promises of glory. But the ritual was never completed. Better go before something happens!",
        "Centuries ago, this vase sealed away a terrible curse. When it broke, the curse seeped into the tomb, twisting everything it touched. The shards still hum faintly, like a heartbeat beneath the earth. Those who try to piece it together are never seen again. Perhaps some things are meant to stay broken.",
        "Long ago, a noble warrior was laid to rest here, undisturbed for centuries. The carvings on the stone promise peace and protection for his eternal slumber. It is said those who show respect may feel his silent blessing. Disturb the grave, and the blessing may turn to wrath.",
        "This grave was once sealed like the others, but someone dared to break it open. The bones inside lie twisted, as if the spirit left in torment. Whispers linger in the air, cold and bitter. Whatever escaped here still roams the tomb, searching for what was taken.",
        "The iron grate feels cold beneath your feet. Beneath it lies only endless darkness, silent and still. No one knows how deep it goes, or what sleeps within. Best not to linger here too long… just in case.",
        "Failed to fetch data. It looks like your scanner isn’t working properly. Getting a new one should fix the issue.",
        "You arrive at the middle of three ancient graves. Its stone lid is cracked and slightly open. Curiosity wins over caution, and you peek inside — only to find a skeleton holding a note: “Finally! Someone to complain about my roommate.” The left and right graves remain silent, but the middle one seems… chatty. As you reach in, the skeleton rattles its bones like a shrug. Maybe it’s warning you, or maybe it’s just lonely.",
        "You peer into the empty grave and see… nothing. Perfect! You decide it’s the ideal spot for a quick snack. Sitting on the stone edge, you unwrap your sandwich and take a bite. The quiet of the tomb is oddly comforting. Even empty spaces can offer a moment of calm and a little unexpected peace.",
        "You stare at the wall of tiny recesses, all of which are empty. “Looks like the tomb ran out of skeletons,” you mutter. On a whim, you start placing small stones in each slot, pretending you’re arranging a very picky audience. “Front row seats for Sir Bones, middle row for Lady Tibia,” you announce, laughing at your own silliness. For a moment, the tomb feels less eerie and more like a very quiet theatre, and you’re the director of the strangest play ever performed.",
        "Long ago, a kind-hearted scribe named Elara served the King. She was famed, not for gold or jewels, but for recording every story, every song, and every secret of the kingdom. When she passed, the king ordered a simple stone podium to be carved in her honour. It was said that, at night, if one listened closely, the whisper of her quill could still be heard writing tales no one had yet imagined. Travellers who knelt before the podium sometimes felt a warm breeze, as if Elara herself was sharing a new story, reminding the world that even in silence, kindness and creativity never truly vanish.",
        "Two stone graves sit side by side, perfectly aligned and untouched. Legend says they belong to twin guardians of the tomb, Aelin and Cael, who vowed to protect its secrets even in death. Travellers who pass by sometimes hear two faint whispers in harmony, as if the twins are still debating which path is safest. The stones are worn smooth, yet the names are clear, carved with care. Some say that leaving a small token on one grave causes the other to shimmer faintly, a silent sign that the twins acknowledge your respect. Even centuries later, their bond remains unbroken, guarding the tomb together in eternal watch.",
        "Three stone graves sit proudly in the centre of the tomb, perfectly aligned as if posing for a portrait. Legend says they belong to the tomb’s original caretakers—Greg the Builder, Sam the Scholar, and Lily the Healer—who argued endlessly, even in life. Visitors sometimes swear they hear muffled grumbles or laughter echoing off the walls, as if the trio is still bickering over who left their tools in the wrong place, or forgot to label a scroll. Despite the centuries, their rivalry continues silently, a reminder that even in eternal rest, some debates are impossible to settle—and that teamwork, apparently, was never their strong suit."
