### Landscape & Location

A small green island on the North East tip of the map. 
Located between the alps in the snowy biome, the suculent forests of the mainland and a twin island '_The Land of Obese Plants_'. 

On the land of this island there is a small gravyard of tech relics that have failed to keep up, were never deemed popular enough for widespread attention or couldn't keep up with the ever changing world we live in now.
